abstract: >-
  QualityFormer leverages uncertainty to guide human parsing. Pixel-wise
  probability maps and IoU scores are used as queries against human feature keys
  to derive spatial and category quality distributions through quality-guided
  cross-attention, which are fused back into the baseline to better model
  inter-part relations. Experiments on ATR, LIP, Pascal-Person-Part, CIHP,
  MHP-v2, and VIP show state-of-the-art accuracy across six benchmarks.
summary: 'Quality-guided transformer that exploits uncertainty for stronger human parsing.'
