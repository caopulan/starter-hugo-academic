abstract: >-
  Semantic segmentation models still struggle on under-represented categories.
  This work focuses on long-tailed semantic segmentation (LTSS) and establishes
  three representative long-tailed datasets plus a dual-metric benchmark to
  accurately profile the issue. A transformer-based frequency matcher is further
  introduced to mitigate the oversuppression of rare classes via one-to-many
  matching and an adaptive query number per class, yielding consistent gains on
  LTSS benchmarks.
summary: 'Transformer-based matcher that mitigates long-tailed suppression in semantic segmentation.'
