abstract: OpenAI recently unlocked native image generation within GPT-4o(mni), showing surprising multimodal comprehension and flexible task handling. This study proposes a taxonomy of six evaluation categories and a curated prompt suite to qualitatively probe the model’s synthesis abilities. Results highlight strong performance on general-purpose generation, stylization, and low-level manipulation tasks, while exposing weaknesses in spatial reasoning, instruction grounding, temporally consistent outputs, and knowledge-intensive scenarios.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
