abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction enable high-quality rendering of complex scenes, yet they struggle to recover detailed meshes for specific targets. OMEGAS introduces a Gaussian-splatting-based segmentation pipeline that extracts 3D-consistent target masks and bootstraps mesh reconstructions before replenishing unseen regions via diffusion priors. Experiments show that the method recovers target geometry with greater precision than existing large-scene reconstruction pipelines.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
